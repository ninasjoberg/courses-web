# Courses web application:

## functionality:

Search for courses

Save a search for later reuse

Save a course (similar to as favourite) for later quick access

Apply for a course by sending their contact information to the institute through a form

View already made applications

## tech:

next.js (using Pages router)

pico.css

## If I had more time I would:

- give user info when an api error occure, better error handling
- input validation in apply form
- spend time on styling and fix ui for small divices
- check and fix accessability
- refactor - split up into more components, move api integrations to seperate file etc
- add some tests
- cache search (not user specific)
- add logging

## Getting started:

`npm run dev`
http://localhost:3000/

run backendservice: https://github.com/ninasjoberg/courses-be
